                                What does "responding to change over following a plan" mean in practice?
                                It means that there is a replacing of a plan with different set of methods to change a project. Change is inevitable.
                                According to agile methodologies, this gives teams a way to cope and respond to change more effectively.
                                While changes are being made during a development process in a project, it's entirely possible for an agile project
                                to have a plan to build an architecture for a project.

                                In a business standpoint, change will almost always occur if it is to lower cost of a project or product, an improvement, and many other reasons on changes to a project or product.
                                There are some ways on how to implement change into a business and here are the steps into doing so:

                            <p>
                                There can be many fundemental changes throughout a business life time from start to finish if the business goes bankrupt like Toys "R" Us for example.
                                Businesses make these changes not only to keep them in business, but they make changes are also called 'Growth Opportunities'.
                                These opportunities taken by businesses are beneficial from allowing the employees to learn new skills, explore new opportunities in the future, and 
                                exercise their creativity to ultimately create new ideas for more projects and an increased commitment for employees to complete these projects as they come.
                                In addition to taking growth opportunities to improve a business in effectiveness and development department, the business will grow in the amount of cash flow per year which will increase the number of job opportunities in that company or business.
                                This will result in a business cycle: Take advantage of growth opportunities leading to overall improvements in a business and finally an increase in job opportunities and cash flow in a business.
